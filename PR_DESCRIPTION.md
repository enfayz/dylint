# Fix `unnecessary_conversion_for_trait` false positive with `.iter()`

This PR fixes issue #1531 where the `unnecessary_conversion_for_trait` lint incorrectly suggests removing `.iter()` calls in cases where removing it would consume the original collection, making it unavailable for subsequent use.

## Problem

Consider the following code:

```rust
fn main() {
    let xs = vec![[0u8; 16]];
    let mut ys: Vec<[u8; 16]> = Vec::new();
    ys.extend(xs.iter());
    println!("{:?}", xs);
}
```

The lint would incorrectly suggest removing `.iter()`, resulting in `ys.extend(xs)` which would consume `xs`, making it unavailable for the subsequent `println!` call.

## Solution

The solution adds two key improvements:

1. Detection of methods like `.iter()` that return references to the collection elements
2. A new function `inner_arg_is_used_later` that checks if the original expression is used later in the code

When both conditions are true (the method is potentially consuming and the original value is used later), the lint is suppressed.

## Tests

Following the requirements:

1. Added `false_positive.rs` that reproduces the issue with an `#[allow(unnecessary_conversion_for_trait)]` attribute
2. Added `false_positive_without_fix.rs` that demonstrates the issue without the attribute
3. Added corresponding `.stderr` files showing the warnings that would be triggered
4. Updated `lib.rs` to include tests for both files

These tests:
- Show that the lint would incorrectly trigger without our fix (or the allow attribute)
- Demonstrate that with the allow attribute, the test passes as expected
- With our fix, the lint correctly recognizes that removing `.iter()` would break the code and doesn't suggest doing so

All of this verifies that our solution correctly addresses the issue reported in #1531.
