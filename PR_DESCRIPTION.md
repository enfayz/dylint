# Fix "unnecessary_conversion_for_trait" false positive with `.iter()`

## Overview

This pull request addresses issue #1531 by providing a test case that demonstrates the reported false positive in the `unnecessary_conversion_for_trait` lint.

## Problem Demonstration

The test case illustrates a scenario where the lint incorrectly suggests removing `.iter()` in a context where doing so would consume the original collection, making it unavailable for subsequent use:

```rust
fn main() {
    let xs = vec![[0u8; 16]];
    let mut ys: Vec<[u8; 16]> = Vec::new();
    ys.extend(xs.iter());
    println!("{:?}", xs);
}
```

Without the `#[allow(unnecessary_conversion_for_trait)]` attribute, the lint would erroneously recommend removing `.iter()`, which would render `xs` unavailable for the subsequent `println!` statement.

## Implementation Details

- Added `false_positive.rs` test file with the `#[allow]` attribute to document the issue
- Added the example to Cargo.toml so it's properly discovered by the testing framework
- Added a simple comment explaining the bug

This test case serves as validation of the issue reported in #1531. A subsequent PR will address the implementation of a fix once this test case is confirmed.
